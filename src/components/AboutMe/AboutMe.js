          Hi! I'm Martyna. 3 years ago I decided to change my life, I wanted to
          change my boring job... I became interested in creating websites and
          it was a 10 shot! I love doing it, but sometimes I hate it :P what is
          normal or nor ?:D when something doesn't work... but satisfaction when it starts
          working? wonderful feeling!
          <TextAboutMeBottom>I want to develop!ãƒ„</TextAboutMeBottom>
          <TextAbourtMeSecondary>and so besides</TextAbourtMeSecondary>
